    <h1><u>Introduction to Chemistry</u></h1>

    <h2>Atomic Structure</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the study of matter and its interactions. 
        Atoms are the building blocks of matter. The structure of an atom 
        consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The formula for calculating the number of neutrons is:</p>

    <p><var>Neutrons</var> = <var>Atomic Mass</var> - <var>Atomic Number</var></p>

    <h2>Chemical Formulas</h2>
    <p>Chemical compounds are represented by chemical formulas. 
        For example, water is written as <var>H<sub>2</sub>O</var> and carbon dioxide 
        as <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var>. These notations help us understand the composition of compounds.</p>

    <h3>Periodic Table</h3>
    <p>The <u>periodic table</u> is an arrangement of chemical elements in a 
        tabular format. Each element is placed in a specific location based on its atomic number, 
        electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. For example, Hydrogen (H) has an 
        atomic number of <var>1</var>.</p>

    <h3>Chemical Reactions</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions involve the transformation of substances. The reaction of hydrogen and 
        oxygen to form water can be written as:</p>

    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

    <h3>Acids and Bases</h3>
    <p>An acid is a substance that donates a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) to another substance. 
        A base, on the other hand, accepts a hydrogen ion. The strength of acids and bases is 
        measured using the pH scale.</p>

    <p>The pH of water is 7, indicating it's neutral, while vinegar has a pH of around 3, making it acidic.</p>
